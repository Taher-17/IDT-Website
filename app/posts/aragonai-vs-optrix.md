# Aragon AI vs Optrix â€“ Which AI Headshot Generator Is Best in 2025?

Artificial intelligence has revolutionized the way professionals create portraits. Among the top contenders in this space are **Aragon AI** and **Optrix**, two apps that promise studio-quality headshots without the camera crew or expensive photoshoot.

But which one truly delivers the best results for your professional profile in 2025?  
Letâ€™s compare them side-by-side.

## What Is Aragon AI?

**Aragon AI** is an online headshot generator that uses AI to turn your selfies into realistic, professional portraits.  
Itâ€™s known for producing natural-looking results suitable for LinkedIn, resumes, and company bios.

However, Aragon AI runs entirely in the browser and relies on a web upload workflow, which can make it slower or less convenient for users who prefer generating and managing their photos directly from their iPhone or iPad.

## Introducing Optrix â€“ The Smart Aragon AI Alternative

**Optrix** is an iOS app built by _Innovative Digital Technologies_ that brings the same professional-grade AI headshot generation to your device â€” with faster results, full privacy, and complete control.

Unlike browser-based tools, Optrix processes everything seamlessly within the app, making it easier to manage your photos, choose different styles, and instantly export ready-to-use portraits.
