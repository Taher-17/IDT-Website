ActivityBuilder collects anonymised usage data and purchase receipt information in order to unlock pro features to users. All data is not linked to you and is only the minimal data required in order to provide our service and ensure it remains functional. Information and permissions required to use ActivityBuilder remain only on your device.

Health data may be requested to display health related Live Activies. This information DOES NOT leave your device and is only used to display your activity rings, steps or other metrics you as the user specify.

As of version 1.7.2, ActivityBuilder will use the AdMob SDK by Google to display ads to free users. Paid users are not impacted.
Device identifiers, general location, crash logs and interaction with the ActivityBuilder app may be collected in order to provide the app experience. This information is not associated to your identity as ActivityBuilder does not require any sign up. 

No information about the content of Live Activities or personal information is collected.
