CryptoDNS only displays well known and trusted DNS providers that ensure safety and security. We do not display or connect you to any of our own DNS Servers. Each DNS provider has a privacy policy and help link listed when you attempt to connect to it which you can view for more information. In addition, CryptoDNS cannot and does not track any network requests you make or anything you do on your device. 

The CrytpoDNS app has no analytics and no third party frameworks or libraries.
