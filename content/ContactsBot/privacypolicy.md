ContactsBot does not collect any information.

Your contacts are fetched from your device and displayed directly on your device. When editing contacts we make changes directly to the contacts on your phone. 

ContactsBot does not include any analytics nor require any form of sign in. Your data is yours and will always remain your device.

ContactsBot allows you to create an export of your contacts. This information is generated on your device and not stored or backed up by us.

We are not responsible for any loss of data. We have included a way for all users to make up all contacts. This can be found in settings.
